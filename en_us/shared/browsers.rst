edX Browser Support
####################

The edX Platform runs on the following browsers.

* `Chrome <https://www.google.com/chrome>`_
* `Safari <https://www.apple.com/safari>`_
* `Firefox <https://mozilla.org/firefox>`_
* `Internet Explorer <https://microsoft.com/ie>`_

.. note:: If you use the Safari browser, it does not support the search feature 
 for the `edX documentation`_. This is a known limitation.

The edX Platform is routinely tested and verified on the current
and previous version of each of these browsers. We generally encourage the
use of and fully support only the latest version.

This information is updated as new major operating system and browser versions
are released. All point releases are supported unless noted; occasional
exceptions are based on specific bug fixes or feature updates.
